ReadMe for NASA Image Search App

A)    Libraries used are  Alamofire,  AlamofireImage, and SwiftyJSON

Decided to use Alamofire for its simplicity in API call interactions.
Less code is always better, I think!
Plus it provides a clean abstraction in the networking layer in iOS. Gives the http calls that swifty vibe.

Also used AlamofireImage here when I realized that it can also pull images here as well! Super useful and clean in how it is integrated with UIImage.

For SwiftyJSON, I used it because of itâ€™s flexibility to handle data types and parsing of JSON.

 
B)    Overview of how app is architected:
There are just two UIViews. The first one you see has a search bar at the top and a collection view. Input your search query to load in search results of whatever you typed in.
    

Once you scroll to the bottom, just press+hold and swipe up again to have the collectionview refresh with more images from the API. Just need to wait 3 secs or so to have them load in.

Clicking on any of the images will bring you to another ViewController that has the details of the picture and time/date of when it was taken.



C)    How to build/run the app

Please make sure to add and install the three cocoapods in the pod file. Once this is done open up the project:  NASA_MediaSearchApp.xcworkspace.

pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.4'
pod 'AlamofireImage', '~> 4.1'
pod 'SwiftyJSON', '~> 4.0'
